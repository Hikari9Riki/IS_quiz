subjective:
  - question: "Explain the difference between 'Thinking Humanly' and 'Acting Humanly' in AI definitions."
    answer: "'Acting Humanly' focuses on the Turing Test approach (fooling a human). 'Thinking Humanly' focuses on cognitive modeling (replicating actual human thought processes)."
  - question: "Describe the significance of the 1956 Dartmouth Conference in AI history."
    answer: "It is where AI was officially born. John McCarthy coined the term 'Artificial Intelligence' there."
  - question: "What is a 'Rational Agent,' and how does 'Rationality' differ from 'Omniscience'?"
    answer: "A Rational Agent acts to achieve the best outcome based on available info. It is not Omniscient (all-knowing); it maximizes expected performance, not guaranteed future success."
  - question: "Compare Artificial Intelligence with Natural (Human) Intelligence based on the characteristics of consistency and cost."
    answer: "AI is consistent, cheap, and easy to replicate. Natural Intelligence is chaotic, expensive to maintain, and difficult to document."
  - question: "What were the primary causes of the 'Reality Check' period (1966–1973), also known as the first AI Winter?"
    answer: "Overpromising, the combinatorial explosion (problems getting too hard too fast), and the Lighthill report which cut funding."
  - question: "Discuss the philosophical conflict between 'Dualism' and 'Materialism' as it relates to the foundation of Artificial Intelligence."
    answer: "Dualism sees the mind as non-physical. Materialism sees the mind as a product of the physical brain. AI relies on Materialism—assuming mind processes can be replicated physically."
  - question: "Explain why the 'Acting Rationally' (Rational Agent) approach is often preferred over the 'Thinking Humanly' (Cognitive Modeling) approach in modern AI development."
    answer: "Thinking Humanly requires understanding the brain (which is hard). Acting Rationally focuses on results (math/engineering) rather than mimicking biology perfectly."
  - question: "How did the field of Economics contribute to the foundations of Artificial Intelligence?"
    answer: "It provided theories of Utility (representing preferences) and decision-making under uncertainty."
  - question: "Describe the 'Neuroscience' foundation of AI and the primary question it seeks to answer regarding the mind."
    answer: "Neuroscience asks 'How do brains process information?' and provides the evidence that thought arises from physical matter (neurons/synapses)."
  - question: "What characterizes the 'Expert Systems' era of AI (1969–1979), and how did it differ from the earlier 'Enthusiasm' period?"
    answer: "Expert Systems used domain-specific knowledge (rules) rather than the general-purpose search algorithms of the Enthusiasm period."
  - question: "Explain the major shift in AI philosophy that occurred during the 'Big Data Era' (2001–Present)."
    answer: "The focus shifted from complex algorithms to massive data. 'Data is the new oil'—simple models with huge data often beat complex models with little data."
  - question: "Discuss the 'Alignment Problem' and why it is considered a significant ethical risk in Artificial Intelligence."
    answer: "The risk that an AI's goals won't match human values, potentially causing it to pursue goals in harmful or unethical ways."
  - question: "Contrast 'AI Computing' with 'Conventional Computing' based on the characteristics of solution methods and data representation."
    answer: "Conventional computing = Numerical, step-by-step, rigid. AI Computing = Symbolic, heuristic, qualitative, and handles uncertainty."
